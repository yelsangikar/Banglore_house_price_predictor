# Bangalore House Price Predictor
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the prices of houses in Bangalore, deployed using Flask and an HTML template. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of real estate listings in the city and is constantly being updated with new data to improve its accuracy.

# Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, you need to have Python and Flask installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then run the following command:

# Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask server on your local machine. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the web application.

# Usage
Once the web application is running, you can enter the relevant details of the house you are interested in (such as location, area, number of bedrooms, etc.) into the input fields and click the "Predict" button. The model will then generate a predicted price for the house based on the entered data.
